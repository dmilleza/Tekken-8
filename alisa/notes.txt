** Pokes **

* b1 *
- i15 -5ob 8oh ; used to poke then see how they react while crouched
- can sidestep, ws4, ws1+2, fc1+2, or fcdb1+2
- if they respect and hold block, keep offense going with wr2, b3, ws3, wr3,4
- frame traps into b1: 
    1. ws4 6oh
    2. wr2 5ob
    3. df1 5oh
    4. 1,1 5oh

* df1 *
- i13 -6ob 5oh ; condition with single hit or df1,1 then use df1,4 for 13ch
- df1,1 is 1ob can be interrupted with jabs

* df2 *
- good for keep-out, risk of getting sidestepped

* 4 *
- i13 -5ob 14oh ; can follow up with b3
- if they respect after hit, can run up and use many moves
- creates a lot of space on block, can use keep out moves if they run in 
- on hit, can be used after wc1+2, df1, f2
- on block, can be used after wr2

* f2 *
- i17 -4ob 7oh ; can follow up with df1, df2, 4 
- mainly used to initiate pressure instead of using after for frametraps

* b3 *
- i20 -8ob 5oh ; has a lot of pushback on block, can wallsplat
- use instead of 4 for ducking
- do not whiff

* df4 *
- i12 -7ob 4oh ; use then backdash to be in favorable range
