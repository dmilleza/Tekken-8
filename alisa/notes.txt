* General *
- formula to win interactions 
    (frame state + move to beat) - 1 = any move equal or below this number
- Alisa has some of the best movement in the game; strong sidestep
- flight cancel has 14 frame window for backup options
- recommended to sidestep at -5ob
- ideal distance is 2-2.5


** Pokes **

* b1 *
- i15 -5ob 8oh ; used to poke then see how they react while crouched
- can sidestep, ws4, ws1+2, fc1+2, or fcdb1+2
- if they respect and hold block, keep offense going with wr2, b3, ws3, wr3,4
- frame traps into b1: 
    1. ws4 6oh
    2. wr2 5ob
    3. df1 5oh
    4. 1,1 5oh

* df1 *
- i13 -6ob 5oh ; condition with single hit or df1,1 then use df1,4 for 13ch
- df1,1 is 1ob can be interrupted with jabs

* df2 *
- good for keep-out, risk of getting sidestepped

* 4 *
- i13 -5ob 14oh ; can follow up with b3
- if they respect after hit, can run up and use many moves
- creates a lot of space on block, can use keep out moves if they run in 
- on hit, can be used after wc1+2, df1, f2
- on block, can be used after wr2

* f2 *
- i17 -4ob 7oh ; can follow up with df1, df2, 4 
- mainly used to initiate pressure instead of using after for frametraps

* b3 *
- i20 -8ob 5oh ; has a lot of pushback on block, can wallsplat
- use instead of 4 for ducking
- do not whiff

* df4 *
- i12 -7ob 4oh ; use then backdash to be in favorable range for wr2, flight,
d3, and wr3,4
- use when back is at wall or to counter aggressive gameplay
- if they don't press on block or hit, re-engage with wr2
- can look for whiff punishes after using df4

* ws1+2 *
- i28 -4ob guaranteed d3 on hit 
- fully charged is 0ob

* fc1+2 *
- -21 -12ob 5oh ; one of her best lows and used as mixup with ws1+2
- use after b1, db3, or flight cancel 

* wr2 *
- i13 5ob guaranteed f1+2 on hit
- duckable, easy to predict and can be floated by jabs
- use more at point blank range rather than at a distance

* wr3,4 *
- i20 -7ob 31oh ; use as mixup with wr2
- can also be floated by jabs

* ff4 *
- i22 -9ob ; use to not get sidestepped or floated with wr moves
- less minus frames on block when spaced correctly

* flight *
- flight2 i16 -8ob ; less minus frames on block when spaced correctly
- flight3 i16 -14ob ; -9ob when spaced correctly
- this stance is all about spacing 
- can also use for okizeme or when they hold block after hit

* db3 *
- i16 -13ob -2oh ; low version of df4, creates space 
- can full crouch mixup after

* d4 *
- i17 -12ob -1oh : d4,1+2 is 0ob and jails 
- good alternative to db3

* d3 *
- i23 -19ob 8oh ; one of the best lows in the game but very risky
- at max range it is safe on block and 15oh
- transitions into backup then crouch stance
