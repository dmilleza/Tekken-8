alternative to dstep4,3,1+2 after a db2 -> hb is ws1 -> 1+4 -> dstep3

* Jodd Guide * 
- dstep and sway after ss1 on block is +10, can use dstep1 for counterhit
launcher 
- db3 is frame 20 and +4 on hit, can pressure after with df1,2 
- df1,2 is an excellent poke with not much counterplay to it
- 1+4 is good in neutral, and hits everytime after db3 on hit
- df2 is safe launcher with -7 on block and does not launch crouching opponents
- dstep1 has good range for a high
- db2 is a great long range mid with a counterhit launcher that is -5 on block, 
also has some high evasion
- 3+4 has less range than db2 but is faster with i18 over i24
- fff1+2 is +4 and has a lot of chip damage
- f1+2 is -14 on block but becomes safe when absorbing moves
- df3+4 is a big gamble to use
- ss4,2 jails because if you get hit by the low, you cannot duck the -7 high 
- nina's main gameplan is to be annoying, first goal is to use heat engager and
play with chip damage. 1+2 enders have big heat chip damage
- df1,2,1,1+2 with heat at the wall does massive damage
- df1,2,1 jails into 1+2 on block
- 1,4 is +1 on hit which is not the greatest advantage
- i10 1,2 is preferred over 1,4 for punishing 
- i11 db1+2 has great range/damage and is a wallspat/heatdash
- i12 b1,4 has good range and second hit is counterhit launcher, is -12 on block
- i12 b2,2,2 is a counterhit launcher, can use last hit if opponent tries to punish
ss after second hit
- i13 df1,2 hits crouching opponents
- i14 b3+4,1+2 has good range
- i14 df3,3 is -10 
- i15 b1+4 is an amazing punisher and one of the best in the game
- i18 uf2,1 and db3+4 is good for punishing long range moves
- ws1 in heat is the best i13 in the game
